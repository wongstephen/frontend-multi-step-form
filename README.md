## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The development time ended up a bit longer than I had originally planned. I started off by designing for mobile first and then moved on to setting up media queries for the desktop view. I used a mix of JS, React, CSS, and HTML to build the app. And to pass data and state between components, I gave the useContext hook an attempt, even though it wasn't something I was super familiar with before. If I had better planned my approach, I'm sure I could have wrapped this up more quickly.
